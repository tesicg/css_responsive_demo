This is simple example of making the page responsive using Mobile First approach.

You can test how the page looks like (for example in Chrome) on devices with smaller width using DevTools (F12). When DevTools appears, click "Toggle device toolbar" icon and change the device's width in "Responsive" mode. You will see the buttons are positioned next to each other on wider screens and they are stacked on smaller ones.
